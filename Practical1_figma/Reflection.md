## Documentation
- The man concepts I applied when doing figma are frame(the fundamentals containers for desigin), layouts(provides
 structure within frames), components(reusable elements, like buttons or icons), instances(copies of components that
 maaintain a link to the master), auto layouts(a dynamic layout tool that allows elements to automatically ajust), 
 prototyping(add interactions and transitions between frames), constraints(allows elements to adapt to different screen)

 - The above concepts are all the new skills and knowledge i have aquried.

 ## Reflection
 - i have leanred how to use frames, layout, create new components, uses instances and create prototype to link two frame together,
  use color schemes and create new shapes and import icons to create my very own personal profile

 - The challanges i have faced were it was difficult to create dropdown, hover and didnt know know components work. It was also difficult
   to use auto layout and constraints as made my desigin go all over the placed. And since i was new to figma is was very difficult to
   find the things that i want to use. It was indeed a challange that i had to overcome to create a simple overlapping shape and i had to watch many youtube videos to able to able to overcome the problems.
