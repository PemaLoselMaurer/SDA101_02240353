## Documentation
- The man concepts I applied when doing this pratical were grid container, grid templetes, grid tracks, placement of items and table

- Creating a gird container and table use css to make a gird and where the item should be. Using table to put the items inside and
  change the color of the words were the new skills and knowledge i have aquired.

 ## Reflection
- I have leanred how to created a grid box, where the text should start, the color of the text and how to use gird templetes. I have 
  also learned how to create a table and put text inside the table.

- When creating grid the lines would overlap and create a mess. The text would not come as i expect it to be and the grid would be 1 by 1 not the 
  row by coloumns i would desire. When creating a table the border would be separeted and the words would not come. To over come this challanges 
  i had to change the gird templetes and add repeat. The words were put in one div so it will be seperate for each coloumns. For the table, I made the border to collapes and put each text td
